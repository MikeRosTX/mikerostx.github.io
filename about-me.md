# About Me

I consider myself to be a DevOps Enthusiast, Community Advocate, Technical Evangelist, and a Community Ambassador who works as an Independent Consultant with customers in the United States and throughout Latin America. I enjoy sharing my views as it relates to the cultural movement of DevOps, and technologies that contribute to the continuous improvement. I enjoy it so much, that people in the community recognize me as one of the integral local organizers of ***[DevOpsDays Dallas](https://www.devopsdays.org/dallas "DevOpsDays Dallas")***, organizer of ***[DevOps Live Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DevOpsLive/ "DevOps Live Meetup")***, and an active global core organizer of ***[devopsdays.org](https://devopsdays.org/ "devopsdays")***.

Since I've been involvement in the DevOps space, I've received exemplary recommendations in social media such as the LinkedIn community groups, and Twitter. My passion in this field shines as I mentor others, and enjoy tackling challenges. My vast experience in helping Enterprise customers for 22+ years at Microsoft in various capacities, serves me as a base as I continue to evolve in my DevOps journey.
