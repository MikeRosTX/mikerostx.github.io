There are two things I am passionate about, Technology and Education.  This is why I frequently go back and review this phrase always looking for new ways to motivate and mentor our youth of the future.  These are the words I live by and firmly believe in:

Time Spent Teaching Is Never Wasted...
If you haven't heard by now, DevOps is a cultural movement that's a hot topic in the fields of S.T.E.M. which if Technology that covers the subject of information technology (IT) amongst others.  In one of my previous posts last year, I shared my experiences with you regarding a high level overview discussion with a group of freshman, junior and senior girls from different local high schools on the topics of DevOps and coding with Chef.  They were so intrigued about this topic discussion, that one of the girls commented:

The first day we went to a workshop that specialized in teaching us what Chef is.  It’s basically infrastructure as code, and that was really interesting and really cool to learn about.
What an awesome way to celebrate diversity, by encouraging and supporting the young girls of today to pursue their future careers learning about coding.  If you have young daughters, nieces and granddaughter that want to follow in your footsteps, then share with them the details of Girls Who Code program that is accepting applications right now.

Their application process opened on January 19 – March 1.  Last year Microsoft hosted girls in our programs in Redmond, Silicon Valley, New York City, Boston and Chicago from out-of-state.  This year Microsoft YouthSpark and 41 other companies partnered up with Girls Who Code, because they believe and support this program.

I know that young girls are not going to ask a man such as myself to mentor them and I don't blame them (wink), because I know they wouldn't feel comfortable.  But I'm sure that if your daughters, nieces and granddaughters are looking for a female role model to be their mentor or ask for some advice, they should be able to reach out to any ladies in the field of IT in their own community or any of the fantastic ladies mentioned in the following articles:

The Women of DevOps - DevOps.com
20 Influential Women in DevOps - TechBeacon
A special CONGRATS goes out to the following 10 ladies which is almost a ¼ of the list recently published as 51 DevOps Influencers to Start Following Today blazing the trail for women in the DevOps space:

Lori MacVittie, Em Campbell-Pretty, Courtney Nash, Esther Derby, Bridget Kromhout, Helen Beal, Elisabeth Hendrickson, Dominica DeGrandis, Alison Gianotto, Liz Keogh.

Girls Who Code is a national nonprofit organization and you can follow them on LinkedIn by clicking here.
